            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Joseph Thao but you can call me Joey. I obtained a bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Arkansas Fort Smith. In the past, I worked in various jobs from turkey polutry farming to laboratory technician and finally to seafood quality assurance technician. I realized these fields wasn't for me so here I am writing my portofolio hoping to obatin a job in the tech field (By the way, so far I'm liking the tech field way more than what I was doing PREVIOUSLY!!!!!).
